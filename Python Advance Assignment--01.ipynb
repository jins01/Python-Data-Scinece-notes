    "##Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
    "Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "Multiple instances of an object can be made."

    "##Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. Because lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance attributes are generated by assignments to self attributes in methods."

    "Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
